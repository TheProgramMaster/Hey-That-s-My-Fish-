# Hey-That-s-My-Fish-
     This is my team (i.e. Gavin Johnson and Kapil Ramayanam's) collective project for CSC 445. 
     This project seeks to recreate the 2003 board game titled "Hey, That's My Fish" for 2-players, 
     as well as implement an algorithm-based AI system for players to play against in a 1 player vs AI setting.
