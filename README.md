# Hey-That-s-My-Fish-
     This is my team (i.e. Gavin Johnson, Kapil Ramayanam's and Maria) collective project for CSC 445. 
     This project seeks to recreate the 2003 board game titled "Hey, That's My Fish" for 2-players, 
     as well as implement an algorithm-based AI system for players to play against in a 1 player vs AI setting.
